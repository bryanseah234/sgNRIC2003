## Speed and Pacing

| Speed | Effect | Use For |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0.8 | Slow, deliberate | Audiobooks, meditation |
| 0.9 | Slightly slow | Education, tutorials |
| 1.0 | Normal | General purpose |
| 1.1 | Slightly fast | Commercials, energy |
| 1.2 | Fast | Quick announcements |

```bash
# Slow narration
belt app run infsh/kokoro-tts --input '{
  "prompt": "Take a deep breath. Let yourself relax.",
  "voice": "bf_emma",
  "speed": 0.8
}'
```

## Punctuation for Pacing

Use punctuation to control speech rhythm:

| Punctuation | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Period `.` | Full pause |
| Comma `,` | Brief pause |
| `...` | Extended pause |
| `!` | Emphasis |
| `?` | Question intonation |
| `-` | Quick break |

```bash
belt app run infsh/kokoro-tts --input '{
  "prompt": "Wait... Did you hear that? Something is coming. Something big!",
  "voice": "am_adam"
}'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Match voice to content** - Professional voice for business, casual for social
2. **Use punctuation** - Control pacing with periods and commas
3. **Keep sentences short** - Easier to generate and sounds more natural
4. **Test different voices** - Same text sounds different across voices
5. **Adjust speed** - Slightly slower often sounds more natural
6. **Break long content** - Process in chunks for consistency

## Use Cases

- **Voiceovers** - Video narration, commercials
- **Audiobooks** - Full book narration
- **Podcasts** - AI hosts and guests
- **E-learning** - Course narration
- **Accessibility** - Screen reader content
- **IVR** - Phone system messages
- **Content localization** - Translate and voice
