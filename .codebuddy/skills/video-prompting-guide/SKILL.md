## Quick Start

> Requires inference.sh CLI (`belt`). [Install instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-sh/skills/refs/heads/main/cli-install.md)

```bash
belt login

# Well-structured video prompt
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "Cinematic tracking shot of a red sports car driving through Tokyo at night, neon lights reflecting on wet streets, rain falling, 4K, shallow depth of field"
}'
```


## Prompt Structure Formula

```
[Shot Type] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Lighting] + [Style] + [Technical]
```

### Example Breakdown

```
"Slow motion close-up of coffee being poured into a white ceramic cup,
steam rising, morning sunlight streaming through window, warm color grading,
cinematic, 4K, shallow depth of field"
```

### Product Demo

```bash
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "Smooth tracking shot around a sleek smartphone on a white pedestal, soft studio lighting, product photography style, reflections on surface, 4K, shallow depth of field"
}'
```

### Nature Documentary

```bash
belt app run google/veo-3-1 --input '{
  "prompt": "Slow motion extreme close-up of a hummingbird hovering at a red flower, wings in motion blur, shallow depth of field, golden hour lighting, National Geographic style"
}'
```

### Urban Lifestyle

```bash
belt app run google/veo-3 --input '{
  "prompt": "Tracking shot following a cyclist through busy city streets, morning rush hour, natural lighting, handheld camera feel, documentary style, authentic and candid"
}'
```

### Food Content

```bash
belt app run bytedance/seedance-1-5-pro --input '{
  "prompt": "Close-up of chocolate sauce being drizzled over ice cream, slow motion, steam rising, soft lighting, food photography style, appetizing, commercial quality"
}'
```

### Tech/Futuristic

```bash
belt app run xai/grok-imagine-video --input '{
  "prompt": "Futuristic control room with holographic displays, camera slowly pans across the space, blue and cyan lighting, sci-fi atmosphere, Blade Runner aesthetic, 4K",
  "duration": 5
}'
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Too vague | "A nice video" | Specify shot, subject, style |
| Too complex | Multiple scenes | One scene per prompt |
| No motion | Static description | Include camera movement or action |
| Conflicting styles | "Minimalist maximalist" | Choose one aesthetic |
| No lighting | Undefined mood | Specify lighting conditions |

## Model-Specific Tips

### Google Veo

- Excels at realistic, cinematic content
- Supports audio generation (Veo 3+)
- Best with detailed, professional prompts
- Frame interpolation available in 3.1

### Seedance

- Strong at dance and human motion
- First-frame control available
- Good for consistent character motion
- Works well with reference images

### Wan 2.5

- Best for image-to-video
- Animates still images naturally
- Good motion prediction
- Works with any image style

### Grok

- Good general-purpose video
- Configurable duration (5-10s)
- Creative interpretations
- Works well with abstract concepts

## Workflow: Iterative Prompting

```bash
# 1. Start with basic prompt
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "A woman walking through a forest"
}'

# 2. Add specificity
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "Medium tracking shot of a woman in a red dress walking through an autumn forest"
}'

# 3. Add style and technical details
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "Cinematic medium tracking shot of a woman in a flowing red dress walking through an autumn forest, golden hour sunlight filtering through leaves, shallow depth of field, film grain, 4K"
}'
```
