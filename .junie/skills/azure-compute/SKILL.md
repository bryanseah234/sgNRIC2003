# Azure Compute Skill

Routes Azure VM requests to the appropriate workflow based on user intent.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks about Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) or VM Scale Sets (VMSS)
- Asks about choosing a VM, VM sizing, pricing, or cost estimates
- Needs a workload-based recommendation for scenarios like database, GPU, deep learning, HPC, web tier, or dev/test
- Mentions VM families, autoscale, load balancing, or Flexible versus Uniform orchestration
- Wants to troubleshoot Azure VM connectivity issues such as unreachable VMs, RDP/SSH failures, black screens, NSG/firewall issues, or credential resets
- Asks about Capacity Reservation Groups (CRGs), reserving VM capacity, associating/disassociating VMs with a CRG, or guaranteeing compute capacity
- Uses prompts like "Help me choose a VM"

## Routing

```text
User intent?
├─ Recommend / choose / compare / price a VM or VMSS
│  └─ Route to [VM Recommender](workflows/vm-recommender/vm-recommender.md)
│
├─ Can't connect / RDP / SSH / troubleshoot a VM
│  └─ Route to [VM Troubleshooter](workflows/vm-troubleshooter/vm-troubleshooter.md)
│
├─ Capacity reservation / CRG / reserve capacity / associate VM with CRG
│  └─ Route to [Capacity Reservation](workflows/capacity-reservation/capacity-reservation.md)
│
└─ Unclear
   └─ Ask: "Are you looking for a VM recommendation, troubleshooting a connectivity issue, or managing capacity reservations?"
```
