## AIDA Framework for Video Ads

| Phase | Time | Goal | Technique |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| **Attention** | 0-3s | Stop the scroll | Pattern interrupt, bold visual, question |
| **Interest** | 3-10s | Keep watching | State the problem, show relevance |
| **Desire** | 10-20s | Want the solution | Show the product/outcome, social proof |
| **Action** | Final 3-5s | Click/buy/sign up | Clear CTA, urgency, offer |

### Hook Techniques (First 3 Seconds)

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Bold statement | "This tool replaced my entire marketing team" |
| Question | "Why are you still doing this manually?" |
| Surprising visual | Unexpected transformation, before/after reveal |
| Pattern interrupt | Start mid-action, unusual angle, bright color |
| Social proof | "2 million people switched to this" |
| Pain point | "If you hate [common frustration], watch this" |

## Creating Video Ads

### Vertical (TikTok, Reels, Stories, Shorts)

```bash
# Hook scene (0-3s)
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "vertical 9:16 video, close-up of hands struggling with tangled cables and messy desk, frustrated energy, shaky handheld camera, authentic social media style, bright lighting"
}'

# Solution reveal (3-15s)
belt app run bytedance/seedance-1-5-pro --input '{
  "prompt": "vertical video, smooth product reveal, clean wireless charging station on minimalist desk, satisfying organization transformation, bright modern room, social media ad aesthetic"
}'

# Add voiceover
belt app run falai/dia-tts --input '{
  "prompt": "[S1] Stop wasting time with this mess. This one product changed my entire setup. Everything charges. Everything is organized. Link in bio."
}'

# Merge video + audio
belt app run infsh/video-audio-merger --input '{
  "video": "solution-reveal.mp4",
  "audio": "voiceover.mp3"
}'

# Add captions (critical for silent autoplay)
belt app run infsh/caption-videos --input '{
  "video": "ad-with-audio.mp4",
  "caption_file": "captions.srt"
}'
```

### Square (Facebook, LinkedIn Feed)

```bash
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "square 1:1 video, professional person at desk discovering a new software tool, laptop screen showing clean dashboard, natural office lighting, corporate commercial style, satisfied expression"
}'
```

### YouTube Bumper (6 Seconds)

```bash
# 6-second bumper: one message, one visual, one CTA
belt app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "6 second product ad, quick montage of a sleek app being used on phone, fast cuts, modern, energetic, brand logo reveal at end, punchy and dynamic, wide 16:9"
}'

# Keep it tight
belt app run falai/dia-tts --input '{
  "prompt": "[S1] Your reports. Automated. Try DataFlow free."
}'
```

## Captions Are Mandatory

85% of Facebook and 40%+ of Instagram video is watched on mute.

### Caption Best Practices

| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Always add captions | Silent viewing is the default on most platforms |
| Large, readable font | Small text is invisible on mobile |
| High contrast | White text with dark outline/background |
| Centered or bottom-third | Standard viewing position |
| Max 2 lines at a time | More text = can't be read fast enough |
| Key words in bold/color | Draws eye to important words |

```bash
# Generate captions from audio
# (create SRT file from your script, then burn in)
belt app run infsh/caption-videos --input '{
  "video": "ad-video.mp4",
  "caption_file": "ad-captions.srt"
}'
```

## Ad Structure Templates

### Testimonial Ad (15-30s)

| Time | Content |
|------|---------|
| 0-3s | Customer states the problem they had |
| 3-15s | How they discovered and tried the product |
| 15-25s | The specific result they achieved |
| 25-30s | Product name + CTA |

### Demo Ad (15-30s)

| Time | Content |
|------|---------|
| 0-3s | The problem (text or visual) |
| 3-20s | Product demo showing the solution |
| 20-25s | Key result/benefit |
| 25-30s | CTA + offer |

### Before/After Ad (15s)

| Time | Content |
|------|---------|
| 0-3s | "Before" state (messy, slow, frustrating) |
| 3-5s | Transition / product introduction |
| 5-12s | "After" state (clean, fast, satisfying) |
| 12-15s | CTA |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| No hook in first 1-3s | Viewer scrolls past | Open with pattern interrupt |
| Landscape video on TikTok/Reels | Letterboxed, looks amateur | Use 9:16 for vertical platforms |
| No captions | Most viewers watch silent | Always add captions |
| CTA too late | Viewers already left | Clear CTA within last 5 seconds |
| Too long for platform | Forced skip or dropout | Match platform duration norms |
| Same ad for all platforms | Wrong specs, wrong tone | Create platform-specific versions |
| Logo in first 3s | Feels like a commercial, gets skipped | Save branding for the end |
| Text in unsafe zones | Cut off by platform UI | Check safe zone per platform |

## Checklist

- [ ] Correct aspect ratio for target platform
- [ ] Hook in first 1-3 seconds
- [ ] Captions added (readable, high contrast)
