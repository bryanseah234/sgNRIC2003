## Tips

1. **Vary sentence length** - Mix short reactions with longer explanations
2. **Include reactions** - "Exactly!", "Interesting.", "Hmm." make dialogue natural
3. **Use directions sparingly** - One or two per exchange, not every line
4. **Keep segments short** - Under 3 sentences per turn for natural pacing
5. **Assign distinct voices** - Use contrasting voices for clarity
6. **Write for speaking** - Use contractions, informal language

## Workflow: Dialogue + Music

```bash
# 1. Generate dialogue
belt app run elevenlabs/text-to-dialogue --input '{
  "segments": [
    {"text": "Welcome to the show.", "voice": "george"},
    {"text": "Great to be here.", "voice": "aria"}
  ]
}' > dialogue.json

# 2. Generate background music
belt app run elevenlabs/music --input '{
  "prompt": "Soft podcast background music, non-intrusive",
  "duration_seconds": 30
}' > music.json

# 3. Merge
belt app run infsh/media-merger --input '{
  "media": ["<dialogue-url>", "<music-url>"]
}'
```
