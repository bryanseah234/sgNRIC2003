```bash
# 1. Generate base product image
belt app run falai/flux-dev --input '{
  "prompt": "Product photo of headphones..."
}' > product.json

# 2. Upscale for high resolution
belt app run falai/topaz-image-upscaler --input '{
  "image_url": "<product-url>",
  "scale": 2
}' > upscaled.json

# 3. Remove background if needed
belt app run falai/birefnet --input '{
  "image_url": "<upscaled-url>"
}' > cutout.json
```

## Prompt Formula

```
[Product Type] + [Setting/Background] + [Lighting] + [Style] + [Technical]
```

"Sneakers floating on gradient background, dramatic rim lighting, Nike campaign aesthetic, commercial photography"

"Skincare bottle with water droplets, spa setting with stones, natural lighting, luxury beauty brand style"

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent style** - Match brand aesthetic across all images
2. **High resolution** - Use quality models, upscale if needed
3. **Multiple angles** - Generate front, side, detail views
4. **Context matters** - Lifestyle images convert better than plain white
5. **Props and staging** - Add relevant props for visual interest
6. **Lighting consistency** - Same lighting style across product line
