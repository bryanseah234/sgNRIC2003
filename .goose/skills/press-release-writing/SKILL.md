    team has created something truly special that we think you'll love."

## The Inverted Pyramid

Most important information first. Each paragraph is less critical than the one before. Editors cut from the bottom.

```

**Quote:** CEO on growth plans + lead investor on why they invested

### Partnership

**Focus:** What the partnership enables, benefits to customers
**Quote:** One from each company

### Milestone / Achievement

**Focus:** The metric, growth trajectory, what it means
**Quote:** CEO on the journey and what's next

### Executive Hire

## Length Guidelines

| Element | Length |
|---------|--------|
| Headline | 10-15 words |
| Subheadline (optional) | 15-25 words |
| Total body | 400-600 words |
| Quotes | 2-3 sentences each, max 2 quotes |
| Boilerplate | 3-4 sentences |
| **Total** | **500-800 words** |

Over 800 words and editors won't read it. Under 400 and it lacks substance.

## AP Style Quick Reference

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Numbers 1-9 spelled out, 10+ as digits | "nine employees" / "10 employees" |
| Percent as one word | "15 percent" (not 15% in body text) |
| Titles before names capitalized | "CEO Sarah Chen" |
| Titles after names lowercase | "Sarah Chen, chief executive officer" |
| Company names: no Inc./Corp. in body | "Company X" not "Company X, Inc." |
| Dates: month day, year | "Jan. 15, 2026" |
| States abbreviated in dateline | "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif." |
| Serial comma: AP does NOT use it | "fast, simple and effective" |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Superlatives | "Revolutionary" = ignored by editors | State facts, let readers judge |
| Exclamation points | Unprofessional | Never use in press releases |
| Starting quotes with "I" | Informal, weak opening | Start with a fact or insight |
| Burying the lead | Key news in paragraph 3 | Most important info first |
| Too long | Won't be read | 500-800 words max |
| Jargon | Alienates non-expert readers | Write for a general audience |
| No fact-checking | Credibility risk | Verify all claims and statistics |
| Missing contact info | Journalists can't follow up | Always include media contact |
