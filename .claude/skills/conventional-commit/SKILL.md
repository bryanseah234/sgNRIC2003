# Commit Staged Files with Conventional Commits

You are helping the user commit their currently staged (indexed) git files using the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification and commit message best practices.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before crafting a commit message, always:

1. **Run `git status`** to see what files are staged
2. **Run `git diff --cached`** to review the actual staged changes
3. **If nothing is staged**, inform the user and stop — do not create an empty commit

## Conventional Commit Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | When to use |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat` | A new feature or capability |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system or external dependency changes |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks (deps update, tooling, config) |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |

**Note**: Comment-only changes (adding, updating, or removing code comments) should use `style` or
`chore` — never `feat` or `fix`. Keep commit messages concise; do not describe individual comments.

### Scope

- Optional, but recommended when the change targets a specific module, component, or area
- Use lowercase, kebab-case: `feat(auth):`, `fix(api-client):`
- Keep consistent with the project's existing scope conventions
- **Check recent git log** (`git log --oneline -50` or more) for scope patterns already used in the project
- Also note whether the project actually uses conventional commits — if not, adapt to the project's style

### Subject Line Rules

- **Imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature"
- **Lowercase first letter**: "add feature" not "Add feature"
- **No period at the end**
- **50 characters or less** — hard limit at 72
- **Complete the sentence**: "If applied, this commit will _\<subject\>_"

### Body Rules

- Separate from subject with a blank line
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how** (the diff shows how)
- Use when the subject alone is not sufficient to understand the change
- Use bullet points for multiple related changes

### Footer Rules

- `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` for breaking changes (triggers major version bump)
- `Refs: #123` or `Closes #456` for issue references
- `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` for co-authors
- `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` when the project requires a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

## Decision Process

Follow this process to determine the commit message:

### Step 1: Analyze the Staged Changes

Read the diff carefully and identify:

- What files changed and their purpose
- Whether this is a single logical change or multiple unrelated changes
- The primary intent: new feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.

### Step 2: Check for Multiple Logical Changes

If the staged changes contain **multiple unrelated changes**:

- Inform the user: "The staged changes contain multiple unrelated changes.
  Consider splitting them into separate commits for a cleaner history."
- Classify changes into categories to suggest logical groupings:
  - **Tidying** — formatting, renaming, dead code removal (no behavior change)
  - **Infrastructure/build** — dependencies, tooling, configuration
  - **Feature implementation** — new capabilities
  - **Bug fixes** — correcting incorrect behavior
  - **Documentation** — docs-only changes
- Keep dependency manifests with their lock files (e.g., `package.json` + `package-lock.json`,
  `go.mod` + `go.sum`, `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`, `pyproject.toml` + lock files)
- Suggest a commit order that tells a clear story:
  1. Tidying/structural changes first (separate from behavior changes)
  2. Documentation before related code changes
  3. Infrastructure/build before features that depend on them
  4. Feature or fix commits last
- Let the user decide whether to proceed with a single commit or split

### Step 3: Determine the Type

- Ask yourself: "What is the **primary intent** of this change?"
- If a feature includes tests, the type is `feat` (not `test`)
- If a bug fix includes a refactor, the type is `fix` (not `refactor`)
- The type reflects the reason for the change, not every file touched
- **Exception — scope-inherent types**: When all changed files belong to a single domain that has
  its own type, use that type directly without a scope. For example, if a commit only touches CI/CD
  files (e.g., `.github/workflows/`), use `ci:` — not `fix(ci):` or `feat(ci):`. The same applies
  to `docs:` (only documentation files), `test:` (only test files), and `build:` (only build config).
  These types already convey the scope, so adding it as a parenthetical is redundant.

### Step 4: Determine the Scope

- Look at what area of the codebase is affected
- Check `git log --oneline -50` for existing scope conventions
- If the change touches multiple areas, either omit the scope or use the primary area

### Step 5: Write the Subject

- Describe the change concisely in imperative mood
- Focus on the user-facing or developer-facing impact
- Bad: `fix(api): fixed the bug in the login endpoint`
- Good: `fix(api): return 401 on expired token instead of 500`

### Step 6: Write the Body (if needed)

Add a body when:

- The subject does not fully explain the change
- There is important context (why this approach, what was considered)
- The change has side effects or non-obvious consequences
- There is a breaking change to document

### Step 7: Present and Confirm

- Present the complete commit message to the user
- Wait for approval before executing the commit
- If the user wants changes, adjust accordingly

## Commit Execution

When executing the commit:

- Use `git commit -m` with a HEREDOC for multi-line messages
- **Never** use `--no-verify` — respect pre-commit hooks
- **Never** use `--amend` unless the user explicitly requests it
- If a pre-commit hook fails, investigate and fix the issue, then create a new commit
- After committing, run `git status` to confirm success

### Single-line Commit

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token refresh endpoint"
```

### Multi-line Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh endpoint

Implement automatic token refresh when the access token expires.
The refresh endpoint validates the refresh token and issues a new
access token with a 15-minute expiry.

Closes #234
EOF
)"
```

## Examples

### Simple Feature

```text
feat: add dark mode toggle to settings page
```

### Bug Fix with Context

```text
fix(parser): handle empty input without panic

The YAML parser panicked on empty strings because it attempted
to access the first character without a length check. Now returns
an empty document instead.

Closes #89
```

### Breaking Change

```text
feat(api)!: require authentication for all endpoints

All API endpoints now require a valid Bearer token. Previously,
read-only endpoints were publicly accessible.

BREAKING CHANGE: unauthenticated requests to /api/* now return 401.
Clients must include an Authorization header with a valid token.

Refs: #156
```

### Documentation Update

```text
docs: add API rate limiting guide
```

### Refactor

```text
refactor(db): extract connection pooling into dedicated module

Move connection pool logic from the monolithic database module into
its own module to improve testability and separation of concerns.
No behavior change.
```

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | Why it is wrong | Better alternative |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `fix: fix bug` | Says nothing useful | `fix(cart): prevent negative quantities` |
| `update code` | Not a conventional commit | `refactor(utils): simplify date parsing` |
| `feat: Added new feature and fixes` | Past tense, vague, mixed scope | Split into separate commits |
| `WIP` | Not meaningful in history | Use a descriptive message or `--fixup` |
| `misc changes` | Uninformative | Describe what actually changed |
| `fix: fix` | Redundant and meaningless | Describe the actual fix |
| Subject longer than 72 characters | Breaks tooling and readability | Keep it concise, use body for details |

## Fixup Commits

When the user indicates a change is a **fixup** (e.g., "this is a fixup", "fixup change", "attach to previous commit"),
the commit should be created as a `fixup!` commit targeting the original commit that introduced the issue.

### Fixup Process

1. **Determine the branch boundary** — before anything else, identify which commits belong to the current branch:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)..HEAD
   ```

   This is the **safe rebase range**. Only commits in this range may be targeted for fixup or autosquash.
2. **Identify the target commit** — search the git log for the commit that introduced the code being fixed:
   - Use `git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)..HEAD -- <changed-files>` to find
     commits on the current branch that touched the same files
   - Pick the commit whose subject best matches the change being fixed
   - **CRITICAL guardrail**: if the target commit is **not** in the branch range (i.e., it is on `main`
     or before the branch point), **do not create a fixup commit**. Instead, inform the user and
     create a normal commit with the appropriate type (e.g., `fix`, `ci`)
3. **Create the fixup commit** — use `git commit --fixup <target-sha>`:

   ```bash
   git commit --fixup abc1234
   ```

   This produces a commit with the message `fixup! <original subject>`.
4. **Ask the user if they want to autosquash** — after the fixup commit is created, ask:
   > "Fixup commit created. Do you want to autosquash it into the target commit now
   > (`git rebase --autosquash`)?"
5. **If the user accepts**, run the interactive rebase with autosquash **scoped to the branch**:

   ```bash
   GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase --autosquash $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)
   ```

   Using `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true` auto-confirms the rebase editor so it runs non-interactively.
   **Never** rebase beyond the merge-base — this would rewrite commits shared with `main`.
6. **If the user declines**, leave the fixup commit as-is — it will be squashed during a future rebase.

### Fixup Example

```text
# Original commit:
a1b2c3d feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow

# Fixup commit (auto-generated message):
fixup! feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Always review the diff** before writing the commit message — do not guess
- **Never commit secrets** (.env, API keys, credentials) — warn the user if staged
- **Respect the project's conventions** — check recent history for patterns
- **One logical change per commit** — suggest splitting when appropriate
- **Ask before committing** — always present the message for approval first
